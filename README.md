LXP Dublin
How we are planning to break down the project:
  1)  We applied the AGILE method, so we began by brainstorming to find an idea which is to make a website platform for job offers for students, where the job offers are related to their studies.
  2) We then made a wire-frame for the home-page, and are still improving it if we find better ideas on the way.
  3) Then we started building our website with HTML and CSS.
  
  1) For the first due date, we made the home-page, a header and a sign-up page for the students.
  2) We then plan on improving our first repository following your comments about it, and with our improvements in HTML and CSS, and make the rest of the website, which mainly consists in a sign-up page for the recruiters, and a sort of job offers page, in the same spirit as platforms like indeed.
  
The AGILE method:
  As mentioned before, after agreeing on an idea and a theme, we started designing our wire-frame, then we started developin our website, with the home-page, a header and a sign-up page. We then submitted our project to you, kind of acting as our review, and will begin the cycle again, following the comments made on your review.
