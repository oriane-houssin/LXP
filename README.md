# LXP
LXP Dublin
How we are planning to break down the project:
  1)  We applied the AGILE method, so we began by brainstorming to find an idea which is to make a website platform for job offers for students, where the job offers are related to their studies. For our theme, we chose digital.
  2) We then studied some benchmarls to get an idead of what we wanted our Home page to look like, then made a wire-frame for the home-page, and are still improving it if and when we find better ideas or ameliorations on the way.
  3) Then we started building our website with HTML and CSS.
  
  1) For the first due date, we made the home-page, a header and a sign-up page for the students.
  2) We then plan on improving our first repository following your comments about it, and with our improvements in HTML and CSS, and make the rest of the website, which mainly consists in a sign-up page for the recruiters, and a sort of job offers page, in the same spirit as platforms like indeed.
  (Being not allowed to use Java Script for this project, we will only work on the design aspect of the parts of our website that would require Java-Script)
  
The AGILE method:
  As mentioned before, after agreeing on an idea and a theme, we started designing our wire-frame, then we started developin our website, with the home-page, a header and a sign-up page. We then submitted our project to you, kind of acting as our review, and will begin the cycle again, following the comments made on your review.
  We chose the AGILE method, because it was the one that seemed most efficient for our project, knowledge and  instructions given.
  
The task distribution:
  Home-page (Oriane Houssin): I chose to make the home-page, because I had some difficulties working with the divs, and grids, problems that I learned to overcome, building the home-page, by looking solutions on the internet, and progressing in the certifications on Solo Learning. I also had a problem of organisation in my code building, (which also participated in my problems with the divs and grids) and so I tried making a code better organised, and intuitive in order to make it more intuitive for my partners on this project.
  
  Header (Flavien Patriarca): I asked Oriane Houssin and Valentin Vegee if I could do the header. It's a personal challenge for me because my previous project that we gave back to our speaker was also a web page and I had a lot of ideas but I couldn't apply them, so I wanted to give it 100% to see what I could do in the end. So I looked for websites with a nice header to give me ideas.Finally, I found one I liked. So I reused the shape I had made for my first website, adding the indications we had given on the wire-frame. A simple and transparent header to see the background of the web page. I didn't manage to integrate correctly a .jpg image to make a menu (three little dots) so I left a button and was going to ask for help when I resumed classes.I understood the difficulty of this header when I saw that I couldn't make it responsive like I had learned in my classes. I still managed to do something in HTML and Css just to make it animated in this project. We were told to put ourselves in the shoes of a user and my favorite thing about a web page is simplicity (not too many elements on the page) and that it looks good.
  
  Sign-up page for students (Valentin Vegee):
  During our group meetings we divided the tasks of the LXP mission between each member of the team so I was given the mission of doing the student register pages. I was asked because I had already made html forms but not these. During this mission I deepened the different functionalities of the “HTML form” system so I used the following tools: 
- label number 
- Email tag 
- Label select
- Label age 
- Simple question label
- Label register 
that wasn't the hardest part. quite understandable is simple to find on the internet. then the css layout was the most complex part because the design had to look like the site shines. So I wanted to make a fairly clean form with the same colors as the one on our site. My css and mainly around the layout to have an easy to use central form. In a second part I wanted to add transitions to it, which I found quite difficult with a form so I only add them on the register button and I would like to add some later but I still think I'm finalizing this page. to fill in the blank so I want to add a float as well as frames is the same header as it shines on the home page
